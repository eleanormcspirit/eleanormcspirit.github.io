    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is the front page of my personal academic website. I recently received my PhD in mathematics from the University of Virginia, working under Ken Ono. My interests lie primarily in number theory. In Fall 2024, I will start as a postdoctoral scholar at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of Larry Rolen.\nIf you would like to contact me, send an email to eleanormcspiritATvirginia.edu (replacing AT with @).\nI subscribe to Federico Adila’s axioms:\nAxiom 1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.\nAxiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.\nAxiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.\nAxiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My research interests concern the intersection of number theory with low-dimensional topology. In particular, I am interested in how and why objects like quantum modular forms and mock modular forms arise in the study of series invariants of 3- and 4-manifolds, which often arise out of categorification/decategorification programs. These questions also make contact with mathematical physics, as many such invariants arise from nonperturbative quantum field theory.\nThis fall, I will start as a postdoctoral scholar at Vanderbilt University with Larry Rolen serving as my mentor.\nThis spring, I recieved my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Virginia under my advisor Ken Ono.\nIn 2020, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in Pure Mathematics and a Minor in Gender & Women’s Studies.\nI was born in Albany, New York and raised in Denver Colorado. I enjoy urban cycling on my e-bike, reading sci-fi/fantasy/weird fiction, playing video games, and cooking. I am also currently learning to play the flute."
