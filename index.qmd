**Welcome!**

This is the front page of my personal academic website. I'm a fourth year PhD candidate in mathematics at the [University of Virginia](https://www.math.virginia.edu), working under [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono). My interests lie primarily in number theory. In Fall 2024, I will start as a postdoctoral scholar at [Vanderbilt University](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/) under the supervision of [Larry Rolen](https://math.vanderbilt.edu/rolenl/).

If you would like to contact me, send an email to *eleanormcspiritATvirginia.edu* (replacing AT with @).

I subscribe to [Federico Adila's](http://fardila.com) axioms:

*Axiom 1*. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

*Axiom 2*. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

*Axiom 3*. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

*Axiom 4*. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
